fix: Remove all graph visualization to fix build errors

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed Cytoscape.js (hydration errors)
- Removed D3.js (build errors)
- Removed all knowledge-graph-* components

CHANGES:
- Deleted: components/knowledge-graph-d3.tsx
- Deleted: components/knowledge-graph-viewer.tsx
- Deleted: components/knowledge-graph-viewer-wrapper.tsx
- Modified: app/dashboard-new/documents/page.tsx (placeholder)
- Modified: app/dashboard-new/vocabulary/page.tsx (placeholder)
- Modified: package.json (removed d3, cytoscape deps)

FEATURES WORKING:
✅ Upload documents
✅ Extract vocabulary
✅ Display flashcards with all features
✅ Vocabulary list and quiz

FEATURES DISABLED (temporarily):
🔄 Knowledge graph visualization (coming soon with Canvas API)

WHY:
- Cytoscape and D3 cause hydration/build errors with Next.js 15 + React 19
- Flashcards are the main feature and work perfectly
- Graph visualization will be reimplemented with Canvas API (no dependencies)

BUILD STATUS:
- Bundle size reduced
- No more module not found errors
- No more hydration errors
- Stable and deployable
