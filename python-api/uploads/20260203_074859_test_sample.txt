    Artificial intelligence is transforming the world. Machine learning algorithms 
    can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions. 
    Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple 
    layers to process information. Natural language processing enables computers 
    to understand and generate human language. Computer vision allows machines 
    to interpret and analyze visual information from the world.
